Dongdong studied at {{< staticref "https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/" "newtab" >}}Zhejiang University{{< /staticref >}} in China where he received a Master of Mechatronics degree in 2016. His research focused on high precision control of hydraulic system at the {{< staticref "http://sklofp.zju.edu.cn/sklen/" "newtab" >}}State Key Laboratory of Fluid Power and Mechatronic Systems{{< /staticref >}} under the supervision of Prof. {{< staticref "https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/0088222" "newtab" >}}Qingfeng Wang{{< /staticref >}}. In January 2018, he began his PhD study at the {{< staticref "http://mechatronics.engineering.nyu.edu" "newtab" >}}Mechatronics, Controls and Robotics Laboratory{{< /staticref >}} in {{< staticref "https://www.nyu.edu" "newtab" >}}New York University{{< /staticref >}} under the supervision of Prof. {{< staticref "https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/vikram-kapila" "newtab" >}}Vikram Kapila{{< /staticref >}}. His current research focuses on planning and control, with a special emphasis on legged locomotion for autonomous robot. He is also more broadly interested in questions at the intersection of optimization, machine learning and their application to legged robots.
