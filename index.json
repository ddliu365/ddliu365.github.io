Since the center of mass (CoM) of a typical humannoid lies at a relatively high elevation, such a robot often experiences instability during its operation and has a high likelihood of fall. Thus, it is necessary to endow these robots with a robust method to reduce damage that may result from the impact of a fall. Prior research on humans undergoing a forward fall has revealed that the deployment of a rollover strategy along the longitudinal axis can lower the impact force experienced on the hand to effectively reduce wrist injuries. Yet, analogous research for humanoids has received scant attention. To address this research gap, in this work, we consider the optimal design, implementation, and examination of a rollover strategy\u0026ndash;similar to the one for humans\u0026ndash;for a humanoid robot by employing a differential dynamic programming (DDP) approach. In addition to providing an overview of the theoretical formulation of our methodology, using results from repeated forward falling experiments with a humanoid, we demonstrate that a reliable application of the rollover strategy considerably reduces the impact force compared with the bimanual fall approach, to protect the wrist of our robot. Moreover, the experiments showcase that the proposed method is also effective in reducing the impact on the torso of the humanoid. With the use of the rollover methodology, a typical humanoid can overcome a key obstacle to its broad adoption and deployment in real-world applications.\n","date":1628380800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1628380800,"objectID":"2dad8fb0e04c016deca3998f1f7a2116","permalink":"https://ddliu365.github.io/publications/rollover/","publishdate":"2021-08-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publications/rollover/","section":"publications","summary":"IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation (ICMA), 2021","tags":null,"title":"A Rollover Strategy for Wrist Damage Reduction in a Forward Falling Humanoid","type":"publications"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1628380800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1628380800,"objectID":"35f64ff52aacd0d08cf09df8c01138c5","permalink":"https://ddliu365.github.io/project/rollover/","publishdate":"2021-08-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/rollover/","section":"project","summary":"A Rollover Strategy for Wrist Damage Reduction in a Forward Falling Humanoid","tags":["control","robotics"],"title":"Humanoid Rollover","type":"project"},{"authors":["Dongdong Liu","Hoon Jeong","Aoxue Wei","Vikram Kapila"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1604448000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1604448000,"objectID":"603daa6bc234da027d47973baf5587c2","permalink":"https://ddliu365.github.io/publication/forecast/","publishdate":"2020-11-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/forecast/","section":"publication","summary":"Fall prediction for humanoid robots is a challenging problem. Increasing interest in the introduction of biped humanoids for diverse applications, e.g., search and rescue in a disaster scenario, necessitates endowing them with robust ways of handling environmental disturbances.

As the adoption of robots in manufacturing, warehouses, and healthcare continues to accelerate, and as researchers examine the use of humanoids for collaborating with and even providing companionship to humans, soon, humans would want such robots to be able to engage in all manner of human-like activities. For example, it is envisioned that humanoids will, one day, be capable of parachute landings to aid in search, rescue, and exploration applications, among others. Specifically, one may seek to deploy humanoids to save lives from disasters in remote areas. Addressing such a problem with a rapid and effective response may necessitate dropping humanoids from an aerial vehicle. However, effective realization of such a strategy requires design, development, testing, and validation of novel robotic solutions to overcome significant technical challenges. Thus, we seek to design and test a humanoid that can land safely and stably using a parachute when dropped aerially. To prevent the failure of key components during landing, we examine and analyze the optimization of the landing trajectory of a biped robot. Previously, researchers have designed a parachute landing fall (PLF) motion heuristically by considering only one side of a humanoid. However, such a model cannot be reliably applied to a full humanoid without considering actual contact environment in trajectory optimization. We consider parachute landing based on a full biped robot with a rigid contact model, utilizing the differential dynamic programming (DDP) method. A cost function is constructed with consideration of the acceleration and momentum of the bipedal torso during the landing process. The optimization process gives due consideration to the constraints, namely, the dynamic model of the humanoid with contact conditions, wherein a rigid contact and a Coulomb friction cone are included for simulation and further optimization.
